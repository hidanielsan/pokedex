# Documentation, API and Modules.
Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a Software Engineer.\
I made this app using React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and API integration.\
To create this single-page React application I used "Create React App"
### `npx create-react-app pokedex`

This app started as a project for the University, but then I gave it some extra hours to make it more complete and functional. I will add more features in the future.\
